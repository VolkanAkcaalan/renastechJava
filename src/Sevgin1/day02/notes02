Folder: Contains files and folders
        Create folder(package) in java:
             Mac: right click - new - package
             windows: right click - new - package

Instalation of Java
Intelije idea
JDK 8

open terminal (Mac only):
                search -> type "terminal" + Enter


 short cuts:
    windows:
       copy: control + c
       paste:control + v

    Mac:
       copy: command + c
       paste: command +v

go to C in windows:
       in search "This PC" + hit enter


class: where we write our codes

main method: runs the codes as java application


             public static void main(String[] args) {   }


IdeaProject folder: It has all the project that we have created in Intellij

              how to find it:
                    windows:
                          This PC -> C -> users -> YourName -> IdeaProject

                    Mac:
                           go to Finder -> search for "IdeaProject"


print statement: prints the output to the console

                    System.out.println();


how to rename in Intellij:

                 right click -> refactor -> Rename -> give the new name

comment : extra notes between codes
          It doesn't effect actual code

          single-line comment: starts with //
          // comment1

          multi-line comment: starts with /* and ends with */

          /*
          comment1
          comment2
          */

escape sequences:
          \t: paragraph space
          \n: new line
          \": prints double quote " on the console
          \\: prints \ on the console
          \': prints single quote
          ' : prints single quote


                Primitive Data Types
                A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

                          There are eight primitive data types in Java:

                Data Type        Size                Description

                byte             1 byte            Stores whole numbers from  -128 to 127
                short            2 bytes           Stores whole numbers from  -32,768 to 32,767
                int              4 bytes           Stores whole numbers from  -2,147,483,648, to 2,147,483,647
                long             8 bytes           Stores whole numbers from  -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807


                float            4 bytes           Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
                double           8 bytes           Stores fractional numbers. sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits

                boolean          1 bit             Stores true or false values
                char1   2 bytes           Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values    'a'

primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

           for numbers: byte, short, int, long, float, double

                 whole number: byte, short, int, long

                 decimal number: float, double

                 range:

                           double > float > long > int > short > byte

                           larger one cannot be assigned to smaller one
                           smaller one can be assigned to larger one

As a default java picks int for whole number
As a default java picks double for decimal number
